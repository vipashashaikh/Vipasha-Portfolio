  "Project Brief  
  For Fundamentals of User Experience Design,
  I worked with three other students to create a mobile 
  application that allows students to come together and 
  batch prepare meals.
  Problem
  We decided to focus on how we could develop cooking skills
  in post-secondary students so that they can learn vital meal 
  preparation habits, given the time constraints
  that students faced on a constant basis.
  My Specific Role 
  I defined the research methodologies that we would use to both
  scope the problem and solution we had at hand. For the
  problem stage, I wrote the interview and survey questions
  that my group would then further refine and use. 
  I also assisted in conducting user interviews at the 
  outset - problem discovery stage - as well as for
  usability testing of low-fidelity and medium-fidelity
  prototypes. I also prototyped during the process, 
  and primarily used Figma to create the medium fidelity 
  prototype of our solution (in collaboration with the 
  rest of the team). I also led the team in further 
  refining this prototype based on user feedback."
